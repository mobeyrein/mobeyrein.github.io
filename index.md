situation so that you can look ahead with intention, knowing that your
decisions in the present directly influence your future and the future
you will leave behind.

We strive to offer you life-affirming clarity of vision as we
compassionately assist you with planning ahead for your final
years, unexpected events, your loved ones, and your communities.

Many people have been meaning to get this important work done
but haven’t gotten around to it yet. We want to help you check it off
your to-do list!

## Our Process:
1. First Chat
2. Complete our Estate Planning Organizer
3. Full Consultation
4. Create your Plan

Twin Vistas Law uses flat rate fees so you’ll know from the outset what our services will cost and you will never have to worry about hourly rates. After a full consultation, we will propose a plan for your particular situation. We offer many services to assist you with your estate plan, which are available separately as needed, but a truly comprehensive estate plan will coordinate multiple documents, and we will typically combine several into a holistic service package.

## List of services offered:
- **Will** ~ ensure your wishes are carried out
- **Trust** ~ bypass probate and control asset distribution
- **Power of Attorney** ~ authorize someone to manage finances if incapacitated
- **Health Care Directive** (aka Living Will, Advanced Directive) ~ specify medical wishes and decision-makers
- **Deeds** ~ title real estate so it passes according to your plan
- **Parental Designation of Standby Custodian of Minor** ~ name someone to care for your children in your absence
- **Business Succession Planning** ~ set up a smooth transition for your business interest
- **Assistance with Beneficiary Designations** ~ determine that your beneficiary designations coordinate with the rest of your estate plan
